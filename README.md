# Practical Machine Learning - Assignment

#### This Assignment is part of Practical Machine Learning Course by Coursera.

#### Using devices such as *Jawbone Up*, *Nike FuelBand*, and *Fitbit* it is now possible to collect a large amount of data about personal activity relatively inexpensively. In this project, our goal is to use data from accelerometers on the belt, forearm, arm, and dumbell of 6 participants. They were asked to perform barbell lifts correctly and incorrectly in 5 different ways (Classes A, B, C, D, E).  
  
#### The goal of this project is to predict the manner in which participants did the exercise. This is the "classe" variable in the training set.
